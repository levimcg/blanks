## Blanks

A decent starting point for building a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site. This is the is boilerplate I use for starting any Jekyll sites. Along with the template files, here are a couple of nice-to-haves when you are getting up and running with Jekyll.

### Bash alias
Adding an alias to your ```.bash_profile``` in your home directory ```~``` will help you get jekyll fired up with a shortcut on the command line. Here is the one I use:

```shell
# Jekyll
alias jek="jekyll serve --baseurl ''"
```

This will start Jekyll, watch your files for changes and rebuild your site automatically.
